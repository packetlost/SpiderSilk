# SpiderSilk
A magazine governance structure built as a decentralized autonomous organization on ethereum

Most of the files have been auto-generated by [embark](https://github.com/iurimatias/embark-framework), so the interesting files are all in [app/contracts/](https://github.com/thair116/SpiderSilk/tree/master/app/contracts) and [test/](https://github.com/thair116/SpiderSilk/tree/master/test)
